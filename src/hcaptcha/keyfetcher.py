"""Unified hCaptcha master-key fetcher.

Returns up to SEVEN AES-256 master keys per build:

  From hsj.js (the inspekt_client / fingerprint bundle):
    * n_key                  — encrypts the `n` token (fingerprint payload)
    * response_decrypt_key   — decrypts hCaptcha server responses
    * payload_encrypt_key    — encrypts client payloads

  From hsw.js (the proof-of-work / AEAD WASM bundle):
    * encrypt_key            — encrypts request payloads via window.hsw(1, ...)
    * decrypt_key            — decrypts server responses via window.hsw(0, ...)
    * n_key                  — the 32-byte AES master-key buffer captured
                               directly at the n-token AES encrypt entry
                               (arg0), read at the moment the bundle
                               invokes its key schedule. Build-static:
                               identical across warmup + JWT calls and
                               across every record in the ring. See
                               ``hcaptcha.hsw_n_key_capture``.
    * fingerprint_blob_key   — deterministic ``SHA-256(hsw.n_key)``; a
                               per-build identifier.

Verification status per key:
  - HSJ keys:                AST-patched key-schedule stack frame; the
                             bundle's own AES output is the witness.
  - HSW encrypt/decrypt:     AES-256-GCM round-trip against the live
                             bundle (mathematically verified).
  - HSW n_key:               STRUCTURAL — the 32 bytes are the AES
                             master-key buffer the bundle feeds into its
                             n-token key schedule, build-static across
                             all calls/records. The n-token body cipher
                             is AES-256-CTR (counter ``iv||be32``, see
                             ``docs/19-ntoken-cipher-solved.md``); the
                             key is reported as captured but end-to-end
                             external decryption needs the master in a
                             usable form (the captured value is fixslice
                             round-key state, not a standard master).
  - HSW fingerprint_blob_key: structural — equals SHA-256(hsw.n_key);
                             always reproducible from the same capture.

        # The current era (d) build inlines the N-key LCG into the vc
        # dispatcher. The constants come from a deobf helper that reads
        # runtime-seeded memory, so we cannot statically derive the key.
        # Instead we patch the byte-store helper to log every
        # (base_ptr, step, byte_value) tuple it writes, run the n-token
        # path once, and recover whatever bytes the build actually emits
        # through that single trace point.
        #
        # On the inspected build this recovers 12 contiguous bytes of
        # the N-key (steps 0..11). The remaining 18 bytes plus the
        # 2-byte key_seed prefix come from writes that bypass this
        # helper (different base_ptr or different step encoding) and
        # are NOT in the trace.  Rather than zero-padding, we ship
        # what we have, document the gap, and verify the bytes we DID
        # capture against the same offsets in hsj.n_key.
